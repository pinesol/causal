    "Imagine an experiment where a researcher is comparing the SAT scores of charter school students to those of traditional public school students. The researcher wants to determine if charter schools cause its students to have higher SAT scores. In this experiment, students may choose to take part in a lottery in which the winners will be assigned to a charter school. People who do not enter the lottery, or do not win the lottery, are put into a traditional public school. Let's also imagine that students who inherentely prefer charter schools are more likely to sign up for the charter school lottery than those who have no preference, and are more likely to do well on the SAT if they attend a charter school.\n",

    "Let $Y^0$ be the SAT score of each student when they are not admitted to a charter school, and let $Y^1$ be SAT score of each student when they are admitted into a charter school.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ D = 1 $ if a student chooses to enter the lottery and wins, and $ D = 0 $ otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "$ Y^0 \\perp D $, since knowing a student's potential public school SAT score does not tell you anything about if they applied or were selected to go to a charter school. $ Y^1 \\perp D $ for corresponding reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, $ (Y^0, Y^1) \\not\\perp D $, since the difference between $ Y^1 - Y^0 > 0 $ makes it more likely that the student inherently prefers charter schools. That is, $ Y^1 - Y^0 > 0 $ makes $ D = 1 $ more likely than $ D = 0 $. \n"
